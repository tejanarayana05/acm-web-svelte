<h4 style="text-align:left;">Hadoop</h4>
Hadoop is an open-source distributed processing framework managing data processing and storage for big data applications in clustered systems. It supports various forms of structured and unstructured data, providing flexibility for collecting, processing, and analyzing data. 
<br><br>

#### ELK Stack

ELK Stack, a combination of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, is a popular choice for modern organizations. Elasticsearch enables fast searching, Logstash collects and distributes log data, and Kibana visualizes the processed data. This stack is crucial for efficient data management. 
<br>

#### Cassandra

Apache Cassandra, a free and open-source distributed wide column store NoSQL database, is ideal for high-speed, online transactional data. Originally developed at Facebook, it handles large data across commodity servers, ensuring high availability with no single point of failure.
