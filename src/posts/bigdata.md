ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka: A Brief

Messaging is vital in modern programming. ActiveMQ is used for reliable communication between distributed processes, optimizing for high message throughput. It supports message-oriented middleware and can push messages to consumers. RabbitMQ is a message queue system for asynchronous task processing and decoupling applications. Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system designed for real-time streaming data pipelines and applications, featuring scalability, data partitioning, low latency, and diverse consumer handling.
